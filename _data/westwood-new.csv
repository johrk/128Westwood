object001,,qXpmAM-ffCM,Green Infrastructure Beyond Flood Risk Reduction (Linda Shi),"Shi, Linda; Kayden, Jerold",2020-09-10,,,"This lecture explores whether it is possible to achieve both social justice and environmental sustainability in efforts to mitigate urban flood risk. The expanding scale of urban flooding under climate change has renewed interest in large-scale restoration projects that make room for water in metro centers. However, ecologically functioning green infrastructure – unleashed rivers, sprawling wetlands – is inconsistent with the current governance landscape of fragmented local governments seeking to maximize local land values and minimize affordable housing. Moreover, even smaller-scale urban greening projects have resulted in gentrification, suggesting that larger-scale green infrastructure projects will produce still more racist, classist, and exclusionary development. The design imagination for new ecological landscapes has far outpaced a reimagination of the institutional and governance arrangements needed to enable nature-based solutions that advance social justice and ecological sustainability under climate change. This lecture provides an introduction to U.S. development practices implicated by these transitional landscapes, suggests future directions such as urban food production and regional governance, and invites conversation about ways to bridge traditional disciplinary silos in creating racially just, ecologically sustainable, and fiscally functioning cities.",Equity; Climate adaption; Green infrastructure; Flooding; Goverance; Nature-based solutions,,,,,,,,Harvard University Graduate School of Design,,MovingImage,video/mp4,eng,"Educational use includes non-commercial use of text and images in materials for teaching and research purposes.
